# Command file that tests server commands that are *not* specific to a session
# or FPC store, with these exceptions:
#
# - the `RESTORE` command is tested with session- and FPC-specific binlogs in
#   `server-session-test.cfg` and `server-fpc-test.cfg` scripts, respectively,
#
# - the `SET` and `GET` commands are tested extensively in a separate
#   `server-option-test.cfg` script (although some `GET`s are used here, too),
#
# - the `SHUTDOWN` command, obviously, can only be used at the very end of the
#   test (see `all-tests.cfg`).
